# Catalyst Squad!

Catalyst Squad is a group that was a consultancy with a lot of work being done in open source.

With the consultancy defunct since 2023, all open source projects have moved to [Catalyst Comunity](https://github.com/catalystcommunity) which is geared purely towards fostering the open source community in the Catalyst Squad way.

Tally ho!
